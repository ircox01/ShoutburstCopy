Ian asked me earlier if it's possible to track a call reason that was used for an email survey. And yes, it's possible right in the current database. It works as follows:

surveys.sur_id -> media_redirects.sur_id
media_redirects.link_id ->company_media.link_id

A 'company_media' table in the database is where AI links are stored, you may use the 'name' field for displaying related results.

Also to make things work faster you may need to create a secondary index on media_redirects.sur_id - that's fine.
